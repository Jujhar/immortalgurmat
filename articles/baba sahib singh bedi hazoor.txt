Born in the month of Chet (Aries) at Dera Baba Nanak
let's listen to authentic chic living of Baba Ji
Akali Phula Singh connates him as a heavenly jewel
the splendour of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's Khalsa Raj.

ਕਾਨਾ ਨੂੰ ਅਰਾਮ ਦੇਵੋ
ਆਤਮਾ ਨੂੰ ਠੰਡ ਪਾਬ੍ਵੋ
ਸੁਣੋ ਸਾਇਬ ਸਿੰਘ ਬੇਦੀ ਕਾ ਜੱਸ
ਸਭ ਜਮਢੋਤ ਚਿੰਤਾਣੀ ਹੋਵੇਗੇ ਭੱਜ ।

Trying the tilak on young Ranjit Singh

Una Sahib was his headquarters
bringing peace to the nation to whoever he met.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
[[File: Derababananak1.gif|thumb|200px|[[Sahib Singh Bedi was born in Dera Baba Nanak]]]]
[[Sahib Singh Bedi was born in Dera Baba Nanak]]. His parents were Baba Ajit Singh and Bebi Saroopha Devi. After being of some months of age Baba Ji was blessed with a brother, Mahboob Singh.

After being of small age father Ajit Singh taught Baba ji [[Punjabi|Gurmukhi]] and after a few days he began to read from the Pothi, he memorized Japji Sahib and did it twice a day. Young Sahib Singh also made it a daily practice to not eat langar until he had darshan of [[Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji]].

===Baba Chanda Singh asks what is the self?===
One day baba ji was seated and Bana Chanda Singh went to visit him, he asked what is ''mai'' (I) and what happens after death hearing this baba ji smiled he said people ask for wealth, children, or some relief of a body pain, and you are here who who want's to know of thyself.

Baba ji tells, the wisdom of oneself can only attribute a tiny amount of understand of ''[[God|ishwar]]'', until he builds up gyan. With understanding (with gyan) [[one disassociates from oneself]] but until then he can not go beyond this context.

===Visit to Anandpur Sahib===

====Meeting Mai Anati====
There were a group of pious ladies living in a village and when news came that even false and extraential (waikari) women were turned into ''devitas'' (Good valued Goddesses and Angels, those giving peace to people) by Baba ji they wanted to do his darshan. They bought donations and Baba Ji greeted them give his blessings and asked them to sit.

One lady from the group was Mai Anati who read lot's of dharmic texts and had great standing in her group. He asked questions that left everyone amazed and energied. She continued to do darshan and listen to Baba ji's updesh.

She had some relics from Hazoor Sahib including Sharda Puran gutka and some shasters which Baba Ji wanted however she did not want to give them up either and Baba ji also wanted them so Baba Ji told her that he called out to her as a mother and she treated him like a mother so she should live with him so her and her son, Charat Singh also moved with and began to stay with Baba Ji

===Telling Sirdar Sudha Singh to tyag his Elephant===
Baba ji travelling from [[Patiala]] to Sanai (ਸਾਨੇ) and met with a man who had come to meet Baba ji on an elephant.

Baba ji taught him that the elephant in his previous life was your worker whom he punished too harshly and got killed for him stealing so he then now wanted badla. Upon more exchange Sudha Singh got to know that he got killed giving his life to Patshah 10 so now he got Sirdari in this life, he was in his previous life one of the 40 muktai (40 liberated ones) who gave bidwa (resignation) to the Guru but under [[Mai_Bhago_ji|Mai Bhago]] returned.

After this encounter Baba ji travelled to Kulgam to take care of his land there, just after a few days of arriving he heard news that Sirdar Sudha Singh was killed by his elephant. Baba ji then returned to Una Sahib.

So this lesson teaches us to obey ''[[hukam]]'' of [[Bhagat|mahapurkh]]s even if we may not understand them sometimes there are deep secrets too and sometimes things are expressed a little differently but eventually the meaning comes out if you continue to obey them even the points you might not understand at the time so take head to the words of saints who practice gurmat / dharm in their life.
