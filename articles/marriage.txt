The traditional Sikh marriage would consist of the [[Amrit Sanchar]] decorum.

Sri Kalghidhar Patshah tells us to honor marriage according to the highest standards to the Sikh way of life with mandatory splendid kirtan and often done at [[Amrit Vela]].

Namdhari Gurus as well as all 10 of the Gurus did their marriage around fire, and all Gurus after Panjam Patshah did with Aad Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji present there. [The introduction of revolving of the Sikhs around Aad Shri Guru Granth Sahib rather than fires was picked up during British times and started by Dayal Britman?? Nirankari] Today
Namdhari Gurus and most Sangat around the world complain about marriage ceremony problems affecting some moderate-knowledge Punjabi speaking populous of following exploitive and unnecessary rules and rituals.

==Wedding Ceremonies==
Patshah ji tells us to keep the ceremony minimal as possible with only the wife's and husbands parents there.
No event before or after should be done even doing [[Akhand path]] or any other paath for marriage is considered a sin and a chance to put a stain on the pure ceremony.

==Prohibitions==
A Sikh shouldn't accept or give money or gifts to obtain wife or give away daughter (including a dowry).

==Khalsa Initiation==
Traditionally Sikhs would be initiated into the Khalsa with the Amrit Sankar ceremony on the day of marriage.
