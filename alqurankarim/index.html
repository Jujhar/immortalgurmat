  <h1 style="margin-top:15px" id="ad1">The Quran Kareem is like a mother
  one way to read it during <a href="">nawaz prayers</a>
another way is reading a <a href="">random verse</a> like a love letter.
<br />
<br />
Allah's book requires we submit<br />our lives and wealth for Allah.
<br />
<br />
Composed between 610 to 632 and written in about 635 AD.
It rocked the world with the aid of (saint of saints) Gabriel [Possibly a saint from Satjug??]
<br />
<br />
The Quran talks about what is the straight/most upright/best path (teaching of Truth and Balance) and contains the best saints of the world.
<br />
It causes healing and mercy for the believers, but it only increases the wrongdoers in loss, truly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for humanity in this Quran, yet most people persist in disbelief. The Quran is a reminder of the gifts of Allah to those that fear Allah. It is a hope that disbelievers/folk will shun evil or it may cause them to be mindful.
<br />
It is an answer to Children of Israel over what they disagree about and sets right the stories of Prophets whose stories have been degraded. Sikhism also believes in many Prophets SAW eg Ram Chandra and Krishna etc. and says there are many many of them [..while talking about the comparison of the Nam??/One Great God??/the Blessed way??].

Sikhismisamorepureformofreligionformoderntimes .
Even though in Islam the Prophet SAW says to marry of slaves thus freeing them in
Sikhism enslaving anyone is not permitted at all as well as eating meat
is not permitted.
Non-mainstream Nehklank Avtar??..or x?? in Islam Sat Guru Ram Singh's
[The Guru of the Khalsa/Pure??] prayer is for The poor and the cow. HE gave woman
equal rights??

Strict fighting against exploitation of the poor or vulnerable is a core value of Sikhs and has been played many many many times in Sikh history and why Sikhs fought Muslims in 17th and 18th century.
Sikhism does not believe in acting negatively or avoiding kafirs/infidels/unbelievers/daints-demons and in fact says those who divide people are kafir. (Guru Arjan) Sikhism strongly believes in uniting people. Thus the belief Ikongkar. The one universal god ੧ behind pagan beliefs??/the world?? ਓ thus validating and uniting both Islamic (Christan and Jewish inclusive) of one God and the Onkar of Hindu, Buddhism, Zoroastrian??, pagan??, etc beliefs.
